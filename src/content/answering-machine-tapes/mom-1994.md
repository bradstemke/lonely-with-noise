Found in a box of cassette tapes at an estate sale, this answering machine recording captures an ordinary moment that becomes extraordinary through the passage of time.

The tape hiss, the slight warble of the playback, and the casual tone all transport you back to a pre-digital era when these messages were the only way to leave a voice note for someone.
