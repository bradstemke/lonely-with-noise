excerpt: 'Intimate messages meant for someone else - a wrong number that tells an unexpected story.'

This collection of messages spans about two weeks. Each message grows more concerned and eventually hurt as the caller never receives a response - because they have the wrong number entirely.

There's something both uncomfortable and moving about hearing these one-sided conversations. It's a reminder of how much communication depends on connection, and what happens when that connection is broken or never existed in the first place.
