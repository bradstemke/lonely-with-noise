The dawn chorus is one of nature's most complex soundscapes. This recording captures a May morning when bird activity is at its peak during nesting season.

What's remarkable is the temporal structure - different species begin singing at specific light levels. Robins start in near-darkness, followed by blackbirds, then thrushes, and eventually the entire community joins in as the sun breaks the horizon.
