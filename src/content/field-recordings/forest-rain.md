Recorded in the Pacific Northwest during a characteristic spring rain, this piece captures the multilayered sound of precipitation in a forest environment.

You can hear rain hitting different surfaces: the high-frequency patter on broad leaves, the deeper thuds on bark, the splash of accumulated water dropping from branches, and the constant whisper of rain on the forest floor's layer of decomposing leaves.
