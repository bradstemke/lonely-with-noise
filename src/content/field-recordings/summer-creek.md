Recorded during the dry season when the creek is at its lowest flow, this piece focuses on the varied sounds of water interacting with stone.

Each rock, each turn in the creek bed, creates a slightly different tone. The recording includes the gurgle of water finding its way through narrow passages, the splash of small waterfalls, and the whisper of shallow water flowing over smooth stones.

It's a meditation on persistence - water always finding its way, reshaping the landscape molecule by molecule.
