This recording captures the transitional moment when a city shifts from night to day. Recorded at 5:47 AM on a Tuesday morning, you can hear the gradual increase in activity as the world wakes up.

The distant rumble of garbage trucks, the chirping of sparrows nesting in nearby awnings, and the metallic scrape of security gates being rolled up create a layered soundscape that's uniquely urban yet surprisingly peaceful.
