There's something oddly comforting about the sounds of a laundromat late at night. The space is nearly empty except for one person reading under fluorescent lights and the machines running their cycles.

This recording features the overlapping rhythms of different wash cycles, the heat and tumble of dryers, and the ambient hum of the space itself. It's both industrial and intimate at the same time.
