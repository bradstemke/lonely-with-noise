Recorded during evening rush hour at a major transit hub, this piece captures the constant flow of movement and sound in an underground space.

The acoustics of the tiled walls create a unique reverb, where every footstep and announcement becomes part of a larger composition. Listen for the warning chime before trains arrive, the pneumatic hiss of doors, and the Doppler effect as trains rush past the platform.
